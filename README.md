> I'm a highly motivated front-end developer with 2 years of experience. I have a strong background in React, Next.js and Javascript, and I have experience developing complex web applications using these technologies. I'm always willing to learn new things and I'm seeking a challenging opportunity to build projects where my experience, skills and extensive training can be fully utilized. I aim to create engaging art that invites viewers to step forward and appreciate a conscious interactive experience.

> Also, sharing knowledge has always been one of the most exciting things for me, and I sometimes produce content on <a href="https://virgool.io/@siavash_sattari" target="_blank">**virgool.io**.</a>
